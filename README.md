AngularJS 
=========

This is a fork of AngularJS (v1.6.9) meant to help teams migrate to lightweight and modular frameworks.

Be very careful if you use this in production.



## Installation


This package is still under development, and is trying to work as drop-in replacement for AngularJS, including the module name (`require('angular')`) - so you're gonna have to clone the repo and link it manually for now:

`git clone https://github.com/kareniel/angularjs-modular` 
`cd angularjs-modular` 
`npm link` 
 
then in your project

`npm link angularjs-modular`
